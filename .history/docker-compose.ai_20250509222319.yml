# Add more AI/video services as needed

# Additional Documentation for Home Automation Stack
#
# General Docker Commands:
#
# Start all services:
# docker-compose -f docker-compose.ai.yml up -d
#
# Stop all services:
# docker-compose -f docker-compose.ai.yml down
#
# Restart a specific service:
# docker-compose -f docker-compose.ai.yml restart <service_name>
#
# XTTS (Text-to-Speech) Important Notes:
#
# - Model Directory Structure: Models are persisted by mapping a host directory
#   (./xtts/models) to the container's default model cache path
#   (/root/.local/share/tts). This prevents re-downloads on restart.
#
# - Voice Cloning: XTTSv2 supports voice cloning from short audio samples (6+ seconds).
#   Store reference voice samples in ./xtts/speakers/ directory for organization.
#
# - GPU Acceleration: XTTSv2 is computationally intensive and strongly benefits from GPU.
#   Without GPU acceleration, speech generation will be much slower.
#
# - First Run: On first startup, XTTSv2 will download a large model (~7GB).
#   This may take significant time depending on your internet connection.
#
# - API Usage: To use the XTTS API for voice cloning, send a POST request to:
#   http://localhost:5002/api/tts with JSON body containing:
#   {
#     "text": "Your text to synthesize",
#     "speaker_wav": "base64_encoded_audio_sample",
#     "language": "en" (or other supported language code)
#   }
#
# - Supported Languages: XTTSv2 supports 17 languages including English (en),
#   Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), Italian (it), Portuguese (pt),
#   Polish (pl), Turkish (tr), Russian (ru), Dutch (nl), Czech (cs), Arabic (ar),
#   Chinese (zh-cn), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Hungarian (hu), and Hindi (hi).
#
# - Audio Format: For best results with voice cloning, use WAV files with:
#   * 24kHz sample rate (preferred for XTTSv2, which will resample other rates)
#   * Minimal background noise
#   * At least 6 seconds of clear speech
#
# Resource Management:
#
# - Multiple AI services running simultaneously (especially Ollama, TGI,
#   Stable Diffusion, and XTTS) can be extremely resource-intensive.
# - Monitor system resources (RAM, VRAM, CPU) regularly using tools like:
#   * docker stats (for container resource usage)
#   * nvidia-smi (for GPU usage if using NVIDIA GPUs)
# - Consider adjusting resource limits for containers if necessary.
#
# Networking Overview:
#
# - All services run on a Docker bridge network (likely homeautomationstack_default)
# - Main service access points:
#   * Frigate UI: http://<host_ip>:5000
#   * Stable Diffusion WebUI: http://<host_ip>:7860
#   * Ollama API: http://<host_ip>:11434
#   * Whisper API: http://<host_ip>:9000
#   * Qdrant API: http://<host_ip>:6333
#   * TGI API: http://<host_ip>:8080
#   * XTTS API: http://<host_ip>:5002
#
# GPU Allocation:
#
# - Ollama and XTTS are configured to use GPU by default
# - For stable-diffusion-webui, uncomment the GPU section for much better performance
# - For TGI (text-generation-inference), consider enabling GPU for practical use
#   with larger models
#
# Text Generation Inference (TGI) Configuration:
#
# - The TGI service doesn't specify a model by default
# - To load a specific model, add environment variables like:
#   environment:
#     - MODEL_ID=mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1
#
# Initial Model Downloads:
#
# - Several services will download large models on first run:
#   * Ollama: Models range from 1GB to 65GB+ depending on selection
#   * TGI: Large LLMs typically 2GB-30GB depending on model
#   * XTTS: ~7GB for the full XTTSv2 model and dependencies
#   * Stable Diffusion: Base models ~2-7GB each
# - Ensure sufficient disk space and a stable internet connection
# - Initial downloads can take anywhere from minutes to hours
#
# Security Considerations:
#
# - Change default passwords (like FRIGATE_RTSP_PASSWORD) immediately
# - If exposing services outside your local network:
#   * Use strong authentication
#   * Consider using HTTPS (via reverse proxy)
#   * Prefer VPN access over direct port forwarding
#   * Regularly update container images for security patches
#
# Updating Services:
#
# - Pull latest images: docker-compose -f docker-compose.ai.yml pull
# - Restart with new images: docker-compose -f docker-compose.ai.yml up -d
# - Check container logs after updates: docker logs <container_name>
#
# PUID/PGID Explanation:
#
# - Used for stable-diffusion-webui and potentially other services
# - Sets internal user/group ID for container processes
# - Ensures correct file ownership on mounted volumes
# - Find your host user's IDs with: id -u (PUID) and id -g (PGID)
#
# Data Volume Management:
#
# - Model and media data volumes can grow very large over time
# - Check Docker disk usage with: docker system df
# - Monitor specific volume directories: du -sh ./*/
# - Consider periodic cleanup of unused models and media
#
# Home Automation Stack Overall Structure:
#
# The complete stack is organized across three compose files:
# - docker-compose.ai.yml: AI and ML services (this file)
# - docker-compose.home.yml: Core home automation services
# - docker-compose.utils.yml: Infrastructure and utility services
#
# Utility Services (from docker-compose.utils.yml):
#
# - Portainer (container:portainer):
#   Web-based Docker management UI available at http://<host_ip>:9000
#
# - Watchtower (container:watchtower):
#   Automatic container updates when new images are available
#
# - Nginx Proxy Manager (container:nginx-proxy-manager):
#   Reverse proxy and SSL management, admin UI at http://<host_ip>:81
#
# - Tailscale (container:tailscale):
#   Secure remote access to your network using Tailscale VPN
#
# - Cloudflared (container:cloudflared):
#   Cloudflare tunnel for secure external access without port forwarding
#
# See docker-compose.utils.yml for detailed configuration of these services.
#
# Backup and Restore:
#
# To back up critical data, copy the following directories:
# - ./frigate/config and ./frigate/media
# - ./ollama (entire directory, not just models)
# - ./qdrant/data
# - ./stable-diffusion/models and ./stable-diffusion/outputs
# - ./whisper/data
# - ./xtts/models and ./xtts/speakers
#
# To restore, replace the directories with the backed-up versions.
#
# Environment Variables:
#
# - FRIGATE_RTSP_PASSWORD: Password for RTSP streams in Frigate.
# - PUID and PGID: User and group IDs for permissions in Stable Diffusion.
# - TZ: Timezone for services (e.g., Australia/Brisbane).
#
# Service-Specific Notes:
#
# Frigate:
# - Configuration file: ./frigate/config/config.yaml
# - Media storage: ./frigate/media/
#
# Stable Diffusion:
# - GPU vs. CPU: Use CLI_ARGS=--use-cpu all --no-half for CPU-only mode.
#
# Ollama:
# - Run a model: sudo docker exec -it ollama ollama run <model_name>
# - List models: sudo docker exec -it ollama ollama list
#
# Note: Home Assistant is defined in a separate compose file (docker-compose.home.yml)
#
# Troubleshooting Tips:
#
# - Check container logs:
#   docker logs <container_name>
#
# - Verify container status:
#   docker ps
#
# - Restart Docker service if containers fail to start:
#   sudo systemctl restart docker
#
# - Ensure sufficient disk space for large models and media files.
