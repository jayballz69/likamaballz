# CODING_STANDARDS_SUPPLEMENT.md

**This file has been reintegrated into Section 23 of AI_CODING_BASELINE_RULES.md for unified reference and AI compliance.**

All detailed coding standards, architecture, and language-specific rules are now found directly in the main baseline guide. Please refer to Section 23 and its sub-sections (23.1â€“23.8) in AI_CODING_BASELINE_RULES.md for the authoritative ruleset.
